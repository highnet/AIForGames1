# AI Steering Behaviors for Games

This project implements classic AI steering behaviors in C# for use in game development, particularly with Unity. It provides reusable components for behaviors such as Seek, Flee, Arrive, Wander, Alignment, Cohesion, and Separation, enabling the creation of lifelike and dynamic agent movement in games.

## Core Technologies

- **C#** (Unity engine scripting)
- **Unity** (game engine, compatible with Unity 2020.3 or later)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2020.3 or newer (https://unity.com/)

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your Unity project and copy the contents of the `src/` directory into your project's `Assets/` folder.
3. Attach the desired behavior scripts (e.g., `KinematicSeek`, `KinematicArrive`, `KinematicWander`, etc.) to your GameObjects in the Unity Editor.
4. Configure the public parameters in the Inspector as needed for your game.
